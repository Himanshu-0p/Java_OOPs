final Keyword â€“ Interview Notes
===============================

### Definition

The final keyword in Java is a **non-access modifier** used to apply restrictions on **variables, methods, and classes**.

### 1\. **Final Variable**

*   A final variable becomes a **constant** once assigned.
    
*   It **cannot be reassigned** after initialization.
    
*   Ensures immutability of the variable value.
    

### 2\. **Final Method**

*   A method declared as final **cannot be overridden** by subclasses.
    
*   Useful when you want to keep the implementation **fixed** and prevent modification in child classes.
    

### 3\. **Final Class**

*   A class declared as final **cannot be inherited**.
    
*   Prevents extension of the class.
    
*   However, you can still **create objects** of a final class and use its functionality.
    

### Key Points to Remember

*   final variable â†’ constant (value cannot change).
    
*   final method â†’ cannot be overridden.
    
*   final class â†’ cannot be subclassed.
    
*   Helps in **security, immutability, and design control**.
    

ðŸ‘‰ In interviews, emphasize that final ensures **stability of code** by preventing unwanted modifications.
