Interview-Ready Key Points

1.Static block executes before main() and only once per class.

2.Used for static variable initialization and one-time setup.

3.If multiple static blocks exist, they execute in the order written.

4.Non-static block executes before constructor and runs every time you create an object.

5.Static block is executed when the class is referenced (object creation, calling a static method, or using a static variable).


Static Block in Java
✅ What is a Static Block?

A static block is a block of code inside a class that is prefixed with the static keyword.

It runs automatically when the class is loaded into memory, even before the main() method or any object creation.

✅ Purpose of Static Block

1.Initialization of static variables
Useful for setting up static data at class load time.

2.Resource loading
Example: loading JDBC drivers, reading configuration files.

3.Code that should run once
Since static block executes only once per class loading, it's perfect for one-time setup.

✅ Execution Order

1.Class is loaded by Class Loader.

2.All static variables are initialized.

3.Static blocks are executed (in order of appearance).

4.main() method is executed.

5.When you create an object → non-static block → constructor runs.
