Constructors in Java – Simplified Notes
1. What is a Constructor?

A constructor is a special block of code used to initialize objects of a class.

When you create an object, the constructor sets up initial values for the object's attributes.

If you don’t define a constructor, Java provides a default constructor automatically.

2. Properties of a Constructor

1.Same name as the class – this is mandatory.

2.No return type, not even void.

3.Automatically called when an object is created.

4.Called only once per object creation.

5.Can take parameters to initialize objects with specific values (parameterized constructor).

6.If you don’t provide one, a default constructor (no-argument) is automatically created by Java. 

5. Key Points to Remember

Default constructor → No arguments, automatically provided if none is written.

Parameterized constructor → Lets you initialize object with specific values.

Constructor overloading is possible (multiple constructors with different parameters).

Constructor cannot be static.
