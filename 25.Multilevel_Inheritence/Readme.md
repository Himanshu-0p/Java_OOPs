<p>🔹 Key Points</p>
<p>Promotes reusability: child class gets features of parent and grandparent.</p>
<p>Follows “is-a” relationship across multiple levels.</p>
<p>Helps build hierarchical class structures.</p>
<p>Only single inheritance per level is allowed in Java (no multiple inheritance with classes → avoids diamond problem).</p>
<p>Constructors are called top-down (parent → child → grandchild).</p>
<p>🔹 Pros</p>
<p>Reduces code duplication.</p>
<p>Easier to extend features gradually.</p>
<p>🔹 Cons</p>
<p>Deep chains can make code complex and harder to maintain.</p>
